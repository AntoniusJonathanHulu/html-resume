        <p>
          I was an independent apprentice participant in the MSIB Batch 4 <br />
          program at PT Asuransi Sinar Mas and was placed at Tekno Body Repair
          <br />
          as an SA (Service Advisor) position. Where I am very proactive in my
          <br />
          work starting from serving customers with claim needs, picking up
          <br />
          units, checking progress via the e-Tekno application and registering
          <br />
          on the PEGA Platform so that the SPK (Work Order Letter) is issued.
          <br />
          With achievement according to target every working day (Documentation
          <br />
          in the form of a photo of the car leaving the Tekno workshop on time).

          My group and I succeeded in building a web profile application for the

          Jogosetran church using the Scrum method. Where our group's web <br />
          profile was selected to be used among other groups. With an <br />
          achievement of 95%, the application runs smoothly both in terms of the
          <br />
          front view and the database and is responsive and structured so it is
          easy to use. <br />
